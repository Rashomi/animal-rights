<h1>Animal Rights</h1>
<p>All animals have an inherent right to live a quality life and the length of their lives should be determined by nature and not the human.</P>


<p>
The implication of this is that no human should kill animals for food, for clothing, or for sport. They should not use animals in the experiments, or entertainment, in a such a way that it threatened the life or the quality of life of the animal.  Every animal fears, the pain, and death and desire a long and a quality life. And the principles of humanity dictate us that we should help and protect the vulnerable and not take advantage of their weakness.  Throughout the history many philosophers, thinkers spoke against animal cruelty and asked us to treat animals with respect and the dignity they deserve.</p>

<p>The camp opposing the animal rights says that animals are little more than eating and breathing robots. They do not think, they do not feel pain or have any emotions, and animal lives have a lesser value than a human life. However, the fact remains that contrary to that thinking, every animal is capable of feelings and have a desire to live a long and quality life. A veterinary surgeon and a University Vice-Chancellor Andrea Nolan in her article titled “Do animal feel pain” says that there are similarities in pain behavior across the species, and non-human animals’ have a well-proven capacity to feel pain as sentient creatures (Nolan. 2015).  </p> 

<p>The human life may seem to have more "value" than an animal life. But that does not give us the right to use the animals as we wish, without any regard for their welfare. How would we value a human life, do some human lives have more value than other humans' lives? How would we treat the elderly and disabled people? Would we kill or do experiments on humans whose lives have a “lesser” value? If so what does that tell about us as humans? </p>

<p>On the other hand, what do we think about a human such as Adolf Hitler?  He is a human and hence his life had a greater value than say of a dog. But who do we think had done a greater service to the humanity?  Is it Hitler who killed millions of people or a humble German Shepard who fights criminals and sniff out drugs on a daily basis to keep the humanity safe, and will give up his/her life, without a moment of hesitation to protect the life of their beloved friend (master)? </p>
 
<h2>Towards a better world</h2>
<p>In spite, of continued cruelty towards animal, it should also be mentioned that there is a growing concern among the humanity on the suffering of animals. More than at any point of the time in history today there are more animal rights organizations at work, and Animal Rights have become a new discipline in prestigious schools such as Yale and Pennsylvania universities. This is certainly a good sign. As any system of welfare or protection to be effective it should not be based on ethics alone. In order to make the world a better place for all living being we need to go beyond ethic. As was pointed out by animal right advocates and a lawyers Antoine Goetschel and Dr. Steven McCulloch ethics, is a system of human values, it is often expressed in ideals but law must be based on realism. </p>

<p>Although ethics is important as a system of people’s values, in law a public prosecutor has a duty to enforce these values. Although ethics is important as a system of people’s values, in law a public prosecutor has a duty to enforce these values. (McCulloch, S. P., Dr. 2012).</p> 

<p>Yet according to an article published in the Journal of animal law and Ethics, the progress in the legislatures and courts has not come close to matching the growing public concern. An article written by Penny Conly Ellison, of Pennsylvania Law school explains the nature of the current animal protection laws in the United States .   “the current animal protection laws in the United States lies in state anticruelty statutes, and they are in large part because of the inclusion of the common exemptions for farm and laboratory animals, their face, they should preclude significant misery suffered by companion animals. <p>

<p>However, as a general matter, criminal statutes are enforced only by prosecutors. As anyone who is active in animal advocacy knows, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to persuade a prosecutor to bring criminal animal cruelty charges, even when the animal(s) at issue are companion animals and the violations are clear. Prosecutorial discretion in determining whether to bring charges is virtually unreviewable. (Ellison, P. C. 2009). </p>
